# README

This project provides a simple command-line interface for using active supervised learning methods.

NOTE: This library is NOT optimized for memory-efficient handling of large corpuses (e.g. hundreds of millions of documents).

NOTE: this project is in an early stage of development and only implements one sampling strategy (uncertainty sampling) with very simple classifiers.
